# Project Hangman

## Introduction
This project implements the classic Hangman game in Python. The game challenges players to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. It provides an engaging way to enhance Python programming skills while practicing fundamental concepts such as conditionals, loops, and object-oriented programming.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to provide an interactive and educational experience for individuals learning Python programming. By developing a Hangman game, learners can reinforce their understanding of basic Python syntax, data structures, and object-oriented programming principles in a fun and engaging manner.

## Features
### Milestone_2.py
#### Create the variables for the game:
- Initializes variables necessary for the Hangman game, such as the secret word, guessed letters, and remaining attempts.
- Demonstrates basic Python commands, including if-else statements and while loops.

### Milestone_3.py
#### Check if the guessed character is in the word:
- Implements functionality to verify if the guessed letter is present in the randomly chosen word.
- Enhances the game's interactivity by providing feedback on the correctness of the guessed letter.

### Milestone_4.py
#### Create the Game Class:
- Utilizes the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm to design and implement a complete Hangman game.
- Encapsulates game logic within a Game class, improving code organization and maintainability.

### Milestone_5.py
#### Putting it all together:
- Combines the functionality implemented in previous milestones to create a fully functional Hangman game.
- Initiates the game and provides an interactive user experience for players to guess the word.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```python
git clone https://github.com/MilanSajiv/Hangman.git
```

2. Run the desired milestone script to explore different aspects of the Hangman game:
```python
python Milestone_5.py
```
3. Follow the prompts or instructions provided within the script to interact with the game and explore its features.
4. Experiment with different milestones to deepen your understanding of Python programming concepts and the Hangman game.

## Example
```python
from milestone_4 import Hangman
word_list = ['apple', 'mango', 'strawberry', 'watermelon', 'banana']
play_game(word_list)
```
